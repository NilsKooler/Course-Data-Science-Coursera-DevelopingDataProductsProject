<h1 id="stormeventsanalysiswithvariablewheathereventsslidershinyapp">Storm Events Analysis with variable Wheather Events slider Shiny APP</h1>

<p>The code for this <b>shiny application</b> is based on the PeerAssment for Courseras Reproducible Research.
One of the questions needed to be answered is The following question:Across the United States, which types of wheather events are most harmful with respect to population health?<br>
When analysing data it could be useful to see what impact it has to include a different number of wheather events in the analysis<br>
For this purpose a <b>shiny application</b> is written to make the number of wheater events a variable.Please note that the code included in this presentation is redundant. Not every shiny code detail is explained.
Please see github repository for shiny app ui.R and server.R code</p>
